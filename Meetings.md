# Nonstandard Meetings:

Discussion Group
: This is not a practice. This is an absence of practice. Place a bid for this if you'd like to get together at the normal dojo time+place, but instead of doing dojo we just hang out and talk about whatever we want.

Dojo Optimization
: The primary purpose of Rationality Dojo is to become stronger and more skilled (.ai mi zenba!), but sometimes the best way to improve is to improve the method of improvement. Getting together to discuss dojo optimization means brainstorming what people want dojo to be, what opportunities for growth and expansion there are, and what existing aspects need improvement.

Review
: Practice makes perfect, but sometimes we need a refresher on the ideas and techniques that have been explored in the dojo recently. You may have been absent or maybe you just forgot. No worries! In this activity is selected we'll just go back over earlier practices and get people up-to-speed.

# Foundational Practices:

Bayesianism: Intuition Calibration
: Main article: [Calibrating our Confidence](https://measureofdoubt.com/2011/08/17/calibrating-our-confidence/)
A good Bayesian is not just accurate, but well-calibrated. What this means is that they are good at knowing how much they do or don't know about something. This is practice at doing exactly that by using short feedback-loops to teach us what being knowledgeable feels like from the inside and being able to report confidence numerically and accurately.

Bayesianism: Probabilistic Thinking
: Main article: [What is Bayesianism?](http://lesswrong.com/lw/1to/what_is_bayesianism/)
This practice involves going through the foundations of probability, reviewing cached thoughts and improving core understanding. Ideally it would involve reconstructing the Bayesian epistemology from first principles, though many participants may not get all the way to the end in one session.
Followup practice: Bayesianism: Network Reasoning.

Being Clear and Specific
: The tenth [virtue of rationality](http://www.yudkowsky.net/rational/virtues/) is precision. To be able to communicate not with blundering, vague clumsiness but instead strike exactly the mental threads that convey an idea with maximum efficiency is a core skill in communication. This skill goes beyond having good conversations, however, as the practice of speaking with specificity, clarity, and precision naturally yields clear, specific and precise thought. This practice involves assorted communication challenges and games meant to encourage effective communication (and thinking).

Debiasing: Anchoring/Framing
: Main articles: [Anchoring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchoring) & [Framing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framing_effect_(psychology))
This practice involves learning to spot situations that might be impacted by anchoring and framing biases, and learning to reorient ones self in said situations.

Debiasing: Bandwagon Effect
: Main article: [The Bandwagon Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandwagon_effect)
Humans are naturally wired to respect popularity above truth. If your social circle all believes something is true, you will be biased to believe that thing even if evidence suggests otherwise. This practice involves cultivating the strength to have different opinions, how to be happy even when holding very different beliefs than your social group, and how to recognize and avoid situations where social pressure results in believing false things.

Debiasing: Confirmation Bias
: Main article: [Confirmation Bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias)
A host of cognitive effects such as selective attention and cashed thoughts make humans predictably bad at revising their beliefs in response to evidence to the contrary. This practice involves learning how to let go of one's ideas and cultivate the practice of ruthlessly challenging them. Truth will stand up to the challenge. Falsehood will fall away.
Note: This practice involves learning to challenge one's own beliefs, not the beliefs of others. Be prepared to support fellow rationalists in their self-reflection, not argue with them.

Debiasing: Modeling Other People
: A whole host of systematic problems afflict our thinking when it comes to other people. [The Fundamental Attribution Error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_attribution_error), [Halo Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_effect), [Illusion of Transparency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illusion_of_transparency), and [Typical Mind Fallacy](http://lesswrong.com/lw/dr/generalizing_from_one_example/) are just the tip of the iceberg. This practice involves rethinking how we model other people, and using visualization, roleplaying, and prewritten exercises to improve accuracy in modeling other people.

Debiasing: Oversimplification
: One of the most classic biases is the tendency to oversimplify. False dichotomies, attempting to define concepts naively, and "post hoc ergo propter hoc" are a few instances of oversimplification. This practice involves learning to manage complexity, including edge case exploration, increasing comfort with outliers, and alternative explanation seeking.

Debiasing: Planning Fallacy
: Main article: [Planning Fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning_fallacy)
Managing time is complicated and hard. We intuitively underestimate how long things will take. This practice involves learning to be better planners, both in terms of implementing planning and time management systems and also in terms of unlearning the natural optimism that most people have regarding durations.

Debiasing: Wishful Thinking
: Main article: [Wishful Thinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wishful_thinking)
Humans are naturally inclined to believe things that benefit them. This practice involves learning to appreciate ideas and evidence which conflict with our worldview or goals, rather than hide from them.

Empathy
: Empathy is a core social skill, perhaps *the* core social skill. While it's valuable to not be vulnerable to the biases of modeling other people, there is a distinct skill of practical empathy. This practice involves learning how to empathize with others effectively, even in stressful situations. Sub-skills involve learning to effectively listen, suspend judgment, suspend problem solving, remain emotionally stable, be compassionate, and communicate to others that they've been heard.

Journaling
: Rationality often involves self-reflection and self-knowledge. One of the best, and easiest paths to self-knowledge is just to spend regular time to write about oneself. This practice involves learning the best ways to write a journal, including what to focus on and how to best develop the habit.

Long-Term Orientation
: Suggested Reading: [Hyperbolic Discounting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_discounting)
It is a common observation that people who are more rational tend to be more oriented on the long-term. That is, as once sees through bias and gathers wisdom they begin to see all the future as equally important. In fact, some see long-term orientation as the foundation of instrumental rationality. In this practice we'll explore ways to shift one's view to the long-term and think about ways in which this can benefit one's thinking.

Managing Emotions: Anger
: Rationality is all about optimal thinking, and one aspect of this is learning how emotions effect our thoughts. Anger is one emotion that is particularly likely (but by no means guaranteed) to provoke irrational decision making, and a master rationalist will be good at managing their anger so that it serves them, rather than hindering them. This practice involves learning how anger affects us, learning to notice anger as soon as it arises, and learning strategies to not let it impair judgment.

Managing Emotions: Panic
: Rationality is all about optimal thinking, and one aspect of this is learning how emotions effect our thoughts. While a mild fear can be rational and good, panic is an emotion which is almost never helpful to effective decision making. This practice involves learning how panic affects us, learning how to keep calm in the face of immense fear, and learning what to do once one notices panicking.

Managing Emotions: Shame
: Rationality is all about optimal thinking, and one aspect of this is learning how emotions effect our thoughts. Shame is an emotion that is particularly damaging to rational thought, and can lead to depression. This practice involves understanding how shame affects us, why shame exists, and what we can do to make ourselves resilient to it.

Mindfulness
: Main article: [Mindfulness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindfulness)
One of the key practices of managing any emotion, gaining clarity, and increasing focus is the practice of mindfulness. This practice is all about learning how to do mindfulness meditation and how to carry that state of mind into non-meditative contexts.

Mnemonics
: Better thinking comes in many forms. One of the standard mental abilities which we have is memory. There's some evidence that raw practice can improve memory, but there are also strategies that one can employ to improve their memory. This practice involves learning to employ these strategies and turn the leaky sieve of memory into a steel trap!

Nonjudgment
: Humans, especially those inclined towards rationality, are naturally drawn to making judgments about the world. We can hear only a few facts about a situation before we feel inclined to match it to some internal pattern and consider it understood. This practice involves unlearning this habit and resisting the urge to quickly categorize or judge a situation, particularly those that involve other people. We will discuss why this is valuable, when judgment is necessary, how it conflicts with Bayesianism and is aligned with oversimplification. We will also practice suspending judgment through roleplaying, pre-written stories, and scientific case-studies.

Numeracy: Algebra and Arithmetic
: Math is a core tool for rationalists, and numeracy has been shown to strongly correlate with rational thinking. This practice involves becoming more comfortable with math and numbers simply by going through highschool mathematics.

Observation
: One of the most foundational skills of the rationalist is that of observation--of collecting evidence. This practice involves becoming better at observing our environment as it is (rather than as we expect it to be), learning to observe our internal state better, and just practicing the brute-force task of remembering what things one has observed.

Willpower/Akrasia Management
: Willpower is the ability to make decisions according to [System 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_process_theory) beliefs, rather than be swept along by System 1 impulses. Akrasia is what we call willpower failure. This practice involves learning to avoid akrasia, build willpower, and develop systems for letting your System 2 beliefs and System 1 impulses come into harmony so that willpower is not necessary.

# Beginner+ Practices:

Bayesianism: Network Reasoning
: Foundation: Probabilistic Thinking
Once one understands how to think about probabilities, the question naturally comes up of how to work with systems that are more complex than toy problems. In this practice we study how to represent systems as probabilistic networks and how to reason within these networks.

Betting
: Foundation: Intuition Calibration
Video: [A Bet is a Tax on Bullshit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgTEcG2qEoY)
It's one thing to understand Bayesianism and occasionally practice calibrating yourself at dojo. It's an entirely different thing to be in the habit of actually making predictions and following up on them in the outside world. One of the best ways to do this is through setting aside a budget to do betting with fellow rationalists. This practice involves understanding why betting is good, how to optimally bet, and to actually find sources of disagreement and put one's money where one's mouth is.
Note: Betting does not require a large amount of money, and participants who are unsure about their skill or financial situation are encouraged to only budget $5 or even $1 towards betting.

Comfort Zone Expansion
: Foundation: Empathy and Managing Emotions
One of the primary ways in which we are systematically held back from our goals is through self-imposed limits. These limits are often good things; we don't go running naked in winter because that would be dangerous. And yet, it is often the case that these limits are closer to superstition than to wisdom. This practice involves thinking about how we are held back through unchecked assumptions and learning how to push and test these assumptions in a safe way. While it can be scary to do things that make one uncomfortable, it can also be very empowering if done right.

Goal Location
: Foundation: Mindfulness
We are not the unified, single beings that we might like to think we are; we are a multitude. Within this multitude are a swarm of goals like "eat!" and "watch a movie!" that vie for supremacy. Some of these goals are terminal, in the sense that they are valuable in and of themselves, while other are instrumental, and serve other goals. Furthermore, we are (by nature) only consciously aware of some of these goals. Very often we can be drawn to things without being able to say why. This practice involves learning to be more aware of what we want, and learning to understand how our various goals might come into conflict in our lives.

Habit Modification
: Foundation: Mindfulness, Akrasia Management, Debiasing Planning
Main Article: [How Habits Work](http://lesswrong.com/lw/ita/how_habits_work_and_how_you_may_control_them/)
Rationality [has been described](http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/06/09/constant-vigilance/) as habit cultivation. That is, the whole point of rationality is to retrain ones-self to think more optimally, and this sort of retraining is more about learning different habits than about learning different ideas. This practice involves developing the meta-skill of modifying any and all habits. Once we are in control of our habits we have the power to reshape ourselves into someone closer to who we want to be.

Identity Reduction
: Foundation: Nonjudgment, Debiasing Oversimplification
Main Articles: [Use Your Identity Carefully](http://lesswrong.com/lw/idj/use_your_identity_carefully/) and [Strategic choice of identity](http://lesswrong.com/lw/jsh/strategic_choice_of_identity/)
It is a natural part of being human to label things, and it is similarly natural to label ones-self. Unfortunately, we are predictably bad at thinking about labels, and this applies even more to thinking about-self labels. This practice involves focusing on how identifying as something puts us at risk (and how it empowers us) and how to think about ourselves without oversimplifying.

Intellectual Vulnerability
: While it's valuable to feel comfortable around other people in general, and it's useful to be able to disagree productively, there's a kind of skill that can often be overlooked: intellectual vulnerability.
Someone who is intellectually vulnerable is comfortable sharing their thoughts and opinions even if they're not well-researched. Why would this be useful? Because it's often valuable to share which way we lean on an issue so that we can collaborate with others to find the truth.
In this practice we will be exploring when the right time to share opinions is, and how to receive opinions in a way that encourages the other person to be open about their thoughts instead of immediately agreeing or disagreeing.

Numeracy: Statistics
: Foundation: Probabilistic thinking, Algebra and Arithmatic
While numeracy is important to being an optimal thinker, perhaps the most important kind of numeracy is that of statistics. This practice involves driving into more advanced probability concepts like expectation, standard deviation, sample vs population variance, and these sorts of things.

Persuasion
: Foundation: Being Clear, Debiasing: Other People, Empathy
Beyond the core social skills of listening and being heard, one of the highest-payoff social skills is that of persuasion. The power of persuasion is literally power over other people, and as such it is dangerous, but also highly useful. This practice involves studying how to persuade people and make a convincing argument, using debate-style techniques as well as leveraging understanding of the human mind.

Prioritization
: Foundation: Debiasing Planning, Debiasing Confirmation
The skill of prioritization is, amusingly, a very high-priority skill. The human mind is naturally drawn not to what is most valuable, but what is most noticeable. Valuable things are often noticeable, but not always, and often we are drawn to whatever is right in front of us, rather than what is most important. Furthermore, there are a host of biases that prevent us from being able to appreciate the costs of various actions. This practice involves learning to weigh values and think in an unbiased way about what actions get the largest benefit for the least effort.

Problem Solving Club
: Foundation: Being Clear, Empathy, Debiasing: Other People
While it's all well and good to study the abstract ways in which our minds fail, rationality is fundamentally about being successful in life. This practice involves taking rationality skills and applying them to real problems that participants are experiencing, brainstorming and planning ways to make their lives better. While the person with the problem will be receiving advice, they won't be obligated to take it, and it should be understood that this practice is mostly just about applying skills of better thinking in a real-world situation.

Social Comfort/Vulnerability
: Foundation: Empathy, Managing Emotions, Debiasing: Other People
Other people can be scary! Even when we might feel comfortable being around someone in a casual context, the act of opening up and sharing things that are real, such as emotions or struggles, can be enormously hard. Evidence shows that the happiest people are those that manage to overcome this obstacle and let themselves be comfortably vulnerable around others. This practice is a special kind of comfort zone expansion that involves learning to trust in those around us and unlearn habits of social defense that cut us off from being connected and happy (and learning when to employ these habits to legitimately protect against dangerous people).

Storytelling
: Foundation: Debiasing
Stories are a dangerous thing. The right story can fill someone with hope, joy, and motivation to keep fighting for what is right. The wrong story can crush spirits and tear people apart. Stories are not just about fiction, they are what we use to guide our own lives.
In this practice we will work to understand how to creatively and rationally craft the stories that help us move forward and be the sorts of people we want to be.

Time Management
: Foundation: Akrasia Management, Debiasing: Planning Fallacy
A core life skill that we all use is managing our time. This practice involves studying methods for using time wisely, planning, and getting the most out of every day.

# Advanced Practices:

Bayesianism: Advanced Epistemology
: Foundation: Network Reasoning
The philosophy of truth (epistemology) that is endorsed by the dojo is Bayesianism. The foundations of Bayes are in the mathematics of probability, but there are questions that need to be answered that require more than being able to decompose P(A&B) into P(A|B)*P(B). This practice involves answering those questions and shoring up the holes in our theoretical understanding of Bayes. We'll talk about where priors come from, how to apply occam's razor, what the law of conservation of expected evidence is about, how Aumann's agreement theorem works, and how to use higher-order Bayesianism to fit model parameters.

Bayesianism: Real Application
: Foundation: Network Reasoning, Speed Practice
It's all well and good to learn Bayesianism to better understand knowledge and truth, but it's even better to also be able to apply the mathematics to daily life. This practice involves randomly selecting someone who wants to learn something or make a decision, and then actually modeling that situation, as a group, using a Bayes Net.

Bayesianism: Speed Practice
: Foundation: Network Reasoning
Understanding the principles of Bayesianism is all well and good, but there's little point to knowing the math if it will always be too clunky and laborious to use when you need it. This practice is about learning skills like representing nodes with odds ratios for easy multiplication, and drilling on exercises to make Bayesian thinking more natural and easy.

Bayesianism: Value of Information Calculation
: Foundation: Network Reasoning
In rationality (and science) we're gifted with many good tools for doing experiments and analysis. This leads to a kind of paralysis sometimes when one is constantly called to continue gathering information. But realistically we must stop experimenting at some point. Bayesianism comes to the rescue again! In this practice we'll talk about how to quantify the value of information and reason about whether an experiment is worth it, or whether we should just act on our current state of knowledge.

Debiasing: Responsibility
: Foundation: Debiasing Modeling other people, Managing emotions, Nonjudgment, Network Reasoning
One of the areas where our natural thinking leads us most away from reality is with regard to thinking about blame and responsibility. A range of emotional reactions and social modeling biases interact with bad models of causality to result in intuitions which may have served our ancestors, but which are clearly sub-optimal for the modern world. This practice involves unlearning these old patterns and applying things like consequentialism in developing a better perspective on responsibility.

Dialectic
: Foundation: Being Clear and Specific, Betting, Debiasing: Confirmation and Oversimplification
Also known as Collaborative Truth Seeking, the process of dialectic is talking with another person to learn the truth. In our context is essentially is the art of having a good argument. For those concerned with truth, a good argument is not one where you convince your opponent, but where the participants quickly and efficiently move towards the truth. We will practice identifying assumptions, staying on-topic, locating disagreement, quantifying belief, and updating quickly.

Distributed Self Mindfulness
: Foundation: Social Debiasing, Goal Location, Identity Reduction
As one dives into understanding the self and the mind it becomes clear that we are not unified, indivisible entities. Instead, the mind is more like a swarm of machines, and sometimes this swarm can act in ways that are self-defeating or inconsistent. Some rationalists have found value in helping reduce the discord of these conflicts by unpacking their sense of self into a plurality of components. This practice involves learning to be mindful of various internal parts and think about how to resolve internal conflict in a healthy way.

Mental Chorus
: Foundation: Identity Reduction, Empathy
While it is possible to think in a deliberate and neutral way, most of our thinking is the result of heuristics and other automatic processes. These heuristics often come bundled together, and set up a mode of thinking that we call "roles". Example roles are things like "artist" or "explorer". Even when confronted with the exact same situation, people can respond very differently depending on what role they've adopted. What can be obvious or effortless for a person in one role might be counter-intuitive or strenuous for another. Towards this end it can be useful to cultivate a collection of mental characters to assist in understanding the world by contributing different perspectives or to aid in taking the right actions by serving as personas to adopt. This practice involves exploring the potential benefits, and the risks, of this "mental chorus."

Non-attachment/Goal Modification
: Foundation: Goal Location, Identity Reduction
As a bit of a sequel to Identity Reduction there is a practice of Goal Modification. Instead of re-conceptualizing who you are, Goal Modification is the activity of actually changing what you want. This practice is deeply aligned with the Buddhist practice of non-attachment, which involves letting go of desire. Like many advanced rationality techniques, goal modification is a double-edged sword. In many cases goal modification can be harmful. However, many times it is the only pathway to realizing higher-order goals, and it is an important skill to be aware of in case it is needed.

Optimizing Community Structures
: Having a rationality-centered community is beneficial for a number of reasons. It serves as a source of ideas and arguments for intelligent and wise things. It serves as a whetstone upon which to sharpen the mind. But perhaps most importantly, there are some aspects of wisdom that require a community in order to work. This practice is all about implementing these kinds of communal rationality. We'll discuss things like markets and infrastructure, and think about areas of our lives (including in the dojo) where these improvements can take root.

Other Optimizing
: Foundations: Problem Solving Club, Vulnerability
Self-improvement is a core activity of aspiring rationalists, but sometimes we don't know the best way to improve ourselves. The strength of community is in having an outside view of yourself that you trust so strongly that you're willing to listen to it, even when it's hard to. Other optimizing is hard. A horde of biases come into play whenever we try and give advice or fix other people's problems. This practice is all about learning how to help other people effectively, and to actually help and get help from the other members of the dojo.
